## Project Description: 

Snake was first launched in 1997 on the Nokia 6110 and became the second mobile game after Tetris. Frantic Engineer was inspired by snake and my previous career. 

Frantic Engineer is about an engineer who is getting ready to bid on a project. However, in order to submit the bid on time, all the proposal sheets will need to be collected. To make it even more difficult, there are obstacles that the engineer could run into making them lose all their sheets!

Can you help the engineer in submitting the bid proposal on time?
